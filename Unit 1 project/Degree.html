        <h2>Interested Beginnings</h2>
        <p>I was interested in programming at a very young age, specifically, video game design. By the end of Middle School, most kids grew out of that idea, but I didn't.</p>
        <h2>Realizations</h2>
        <p>Midway through High School, I looked more in-depth and realized something difficult to swallow. Video Game Design doesn't have a lot of oppurtunities in it, so it wouldn't help me much in the long term.</p>
        <h2>Change</h2>
        <h2>Near the end of High School, I decided to go for Computer Programming instead, which has led to where I am now.</h2>
